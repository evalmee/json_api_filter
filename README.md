## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'json_api_filter'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install json_api_filter
```

## Usage

### Quick start

To filter this request `/books?filter[library_id]=1,2&filter[author_id]=12&search=Lord of the ring&include=users,users.posts`

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationController

  include JsonApiFilter
  permitted_filters  %i[library_id author_id]
  permitted_searches :user_search
  permitted_inclusions %i[users users.posts]

  def index
    @books = json_api_filter(Book, params)
    inclusions = json_api_inclusions(params) # returns [:users, :'users.posts']

    # then use `inclusions` in the serialiser
    BookSerializer.new(@books, include: inclusions).serializable_hash.to_json
  end
end

```

- `permitted_filters` let you define allowed attributes to filter on (mandatory)
- `permitted_searches` let you define the allowed search method defined in you model what will be called if you pass `search` params in your request (can be a pg_search scope)
- `permitted_inclusions` let you define the allowed inclusions
- `json_api_filter(scope, params)` return an active record relation (`Book::` in this example)

# Use inclusions in serializers

# Handling errors

If an endpoint does not support the include parameter, it MUST respond with 400 Bad Request to any requests that include it.

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationController

  include JsonApiFilter
  permitted_filters  %i[library_id author_id]
  permitted_searches :user_search
  
  rescue_from JsonApiFilter::MissingPermittedInclusionError, with: :render_400

  def index
    @books = json_api_filter(Book, params)
    inclusions = json_api_inclusions(params) # raises JsonApiFilter::MissingPermittedInclusionError
  end
  
  private
  
  def render_400(exception)
    render json: exception, status: 400
  end
end
```

If a server is unable to identify a relationship path or does not support inclusion of resources from a path, it MUST respond with 400 Bad Request.
This request should return a 400 status:

 `/books?filter[library_id]=1,2&filter[author_id]=12&search=Lord of the ring&include=users,users.posts, users.addresses`

```ruby
class Book < ApplicationController

  include JsonApiFilter
  permitted_filters  %i[library_id author_id]
  permitted_searches :user_search
  permitted_inclusions %i[users users.posts]

  rescue_from JsonApiFilter::UnknownInclusionsError, with: :render_400

  def index
    @books = json_api_filter(Book, params)
    inclusions = json_api_inclusions(params) # raises JsonApiFilter::UnknownInclusionsError
  end

  private

  def render_400(exception)
    render json: exception, status: 400
  end
end
```

## Migration from 0.1
0.2.x version is not compatible with 0.1
In your controller, you will have to replace all occurrences of `attr_filter` as bellow :

### Before
```ruby
def index 
  @books = Book.all.where(attr_filter(params))
end
```

### After
```ruby
def index
  @books = json_api_filter(Book, params)
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
